   WHEN           WHAT 
  ------         ------
  
  19th Sep '12   Added 'gnomeless' compilation mode to build script, which is
                 automagically used when running the unit tests!
  
  5th Sep '12    We're now suppressing notifications after the system has resumed 
                 from suspension or hibernation, which is particularly handy for 
                 virtual machines that are constantly brought in and out of these
                 modes. Additionally, notifications are also being suppressed until 
                 after the first successful service 'poll' has been achieved. 
                 This means we won't get a flood of old notifications if the initial 
                 (suppressed) batch didn't update the last notification states 
                 due to failure.
